scapyHunt is an objective-based game in which you will use common network attack vectors 
and penetration testing methods to analyze and compromise a virtual network.

The network itself is completely defined by custom-made packets which simulate a typical network setup.

All communications with the network must happen over the 'tap0' interface- 
be sure to set the interface argument when using the tools listed below.

Have fun :)

GOAL
-----
There is an FTP server somewhere on the network containing a very important document.
Locate the server, and find a way to connect to the service and retrieve it.

-----
TOOLS
-----
- scapy
- nmap
- wireshark
- telnet/nc
- dsniff

-----
CONCEPTS
-----
- Packet capture and manipulation in scapy
- Packet analysis in wireshark
- Router modes of operation
- Network topography, gateways
- Basic telnet/nc commands

-----
HINTS
-----
- You may need to find a way to see all of the traffic on the network.
- Other clients on the network might give you useful clues, if you can coerce them.
- The target will most likely be isolated from the immediate local network, and will have some preferred clients.
