1) Use nmap to determine the clients on the network.
2) Perform a CAM Table overflow attack on the network to force the router into 'Hub' mode. Traffic will now be broadcasted to all clients.
3) Use wireshark to determine the port-knocking sequence from one host to the other.
4) Copy this sequence using scapy. It may help to capture some packets into scapy and base yours off of these.
