LEVEL 1 - Knock, knock

There is an FTP server somewhere on the network which you need access to. 
Locate the server and find a way to connect to the service.

HINTS
-----
- You may need to find a way to see all of the traffic on the network.
- Other clients on the network might give you useful clues, if you can coerce them.
- The target will most likely be isolated from the immediate local network, and will have some preferred clients.
