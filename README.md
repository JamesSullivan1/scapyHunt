**scapyHunt** - A series of Network Security puzzles and challenges designed to educate users on packet manipulation
and common network attacks. 

Creates a TUN/TAP interface for a software defined network, over which packets will be sent by the
user- either hand crafted or using a variety of tools- in order to achieve a given objective.

Uses scapy, a Python packet manipulation library.
