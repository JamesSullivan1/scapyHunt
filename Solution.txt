1) Use nmap to determine the clients on the network.
 Ex) nmap -e tap0 -sn 10.5.0.0/24
 
2) Perform a CAM Table overflow attack on the network to force the router into 'Hub' mode. Traffic will now be broadcasted to all clients.
 Ex) macof -I tap0
 
3) Use wireshark to determine the port-knocking sequence from one host to the other. Be sure to capture the right interface.

4) Copy this sequence using scapy. It may help to capture some packets into scapy and base yours off of these.
 Ex) in scapy:
    a = sniff(iface='tap0', filter = 'tcp and src 10.5.0.4', prn = lambda x: x.summary())
    for p in a:
      # do something to the packets...
      sendp(p, iface='tap0')

5) Use nmap to determine which service is now open to you on the recipient of the knock sequence
 Ex) sudo nmap 10.5.0.6 -e tap0

6) Connect via telnet or nc to the given service. Try a standard command from here to get the clue.
 Ex) nc 10.5.0.6 [port]

7) Use some standard service commands to query information from the service. This information will help you find the target.

8) The target is configured to decline packets except from particular IP addresses. You will need to perform an ARP spoof on one of these hosts- observe network traffic to see who they accept.

9) Connect to the FTP service and retrieve the payload.
